* What is this?
This simple contribution layer is an example. It installs around 100 themes
for Emacs. You can try them easily by invoking helm-themes with: ~<SPC> T h~.

You can see samples of all included themes in this [[http://themegallery.robdor.com][theme gallery]] from [[http://www.twitter.com/robmerrell][Rob Merrell]].

* Install
See [[spacemacs-doc:How to install][how to install configuration layers]] in the main documentation.
